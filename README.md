# Babylon Native

Welcome! Babylon Native is a collection of technologies intended to bring 
the power and flexibility of Babylon.js to cross-platform applications beyond the 
browser. The goal of this project is to allow the same JavaScript that powers Babylon.js 
apps on the Web to work identically in native apps on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and 
Linux.

Check out the [home page](https://aka.ms/Bnative) for a project overview.
