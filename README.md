# Babylon Native

Build cross-platform native applications with the power of the Babylon.js JavaScript framework.

See [this blog entry](https://medium.com/@babylonjs/babylon-native-821f1694fffc) for more details.

*This project is under heavy development. Not all intended platforms are currently implemented. **DO NOT** use in production code.*

## Getting Started

### Windows

#### Prerequisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.12 or higher
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.x
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 2019 (16.3 or higher)

#### Build

- Clone this repo.
- Update the submodules.
  ```
  C:\BabylonNative>git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
- Create a new directory for the build files, e.g. `Build` at the root of the repo.
  ```
  C:\BabylonNative>mkdir Build
  ```
- Change your working directory to the new directory.
  ```
  C:\BabylonNative>cd Build
  ```
- Run CMake from the new directory and point to the root of the repo.

    NOTE: If you get the CMake error *No preprocessor test for "Intel"*, update your Visual Studio to 16.3 or higher.
  ```
  C:\BabylonNative\Build>cmake ..
  ```
- Open the generated solution `BabylonNative.sln`.
  ```
  C:\BabylonNative\Build>start BabylonNative.sln
  ```
- Once the solution opens, right click the TestApp project, click "Set as StartUp Project" and click the play button at the top to run the test app which should render a box

### Android / iOS / MacOS

*Planned but not yet implemented*

## Development Notes

### glslang and SPIRV-Cross

In order to compile the WebGL GLSL shader to the required bits for the target platform, this project utilizes [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) and [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross). See [ShaderCompiler.h](./Library/Source/ShaderCompiler.h) and its corresponding implementation for details.

### arcana.cpp

This project makes substantial use of the utilities contained within the [arcana.cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/arcana.cpp) project, especially the support for asynchronous task execution and thread synchronization.

### N-API

This project uses a subset of [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) and the JavaScript part of [N-API](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/src/js_native_api.h) to target either V8 or Chakra. See [this thread](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/354) for some context. There is also [work](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/issues/399) needed to factor out the JavaScript part of node-addon-api.

The code is located [here](./Library/Dependencies/napi). Some small modifications were made to avoid node dependencies and improve performance. The Chakra version [js_native_api_chakra.cc](./Library/Dependencies/napi/source/js_native_api_chakra.cc) came from [node_api_jsrt.cc](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore/blob/master/src/node_api_jsrt.cc) and was modified to target Chakra directly. We will work on submitting these changes to the public version.

### bgfx

This project uses [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) for the cross-platform rendering abstraction. It does not use the shader abstraction of bgfx, but instead [compiles the WebGL GLSL shader at runtime](#glslang-and-SPIRV-Cross) and generates the shader header that bgfx expects. See [NativeEngine.cpp](./Library/Source/NativeEngine.cpp) for implementation details.

### base-n

This project uses [base-n](https://github.com/azawadzki/base-n) to implement base64 decoding for parsing data URLs.

### curl

This project uses [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) (or, more accurately, [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)) as the backend for the provided implementation of XMLHttpRequest. At present, only a "golden path" is supported, but additional features will be added as they are required.
