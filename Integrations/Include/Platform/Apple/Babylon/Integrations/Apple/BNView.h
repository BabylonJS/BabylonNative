// BNView.h — public Obj-C interface for the Babylon::Integrations view

//
// Construct against a host-provided `MTKView`. The first BNView against
// a given BNRuntime triggers GPU device construction, plugin init, and
// queued-script flushing. Subsequent attaches are cheap surface rebinds.
//
// If the MTKView has no delegate when BNView is constructed, BNView
// installs and retains a `BNViewDelegate` automatically. If the host
// installed a delegate first (typically a BNViewDelegate subclass for
// per-frame work), BNView leaves it alone.
