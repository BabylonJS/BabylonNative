# Validation Tests
Validation tests load playground, perform rendering and compare the results with a reference Image.
The reference is part of the repo so adding new tests is updating the tests list and commit a new reference image.

# Playground

Most of the tests are [playground made on the web](https://playground.babylonjs.com/)
Once it's done, you can save it, get a snippet Id and add it to the test lists.

# Tests lists

In order to add a new test scene, first thing to do is to add a few lines in `Apps\ValidationTests\Scripts\config.json`. 

```json
{
    "root": "https://cdn.babylonjs.com",
    "tests": [
        {
            "title": "setParent",
            "playgroundId": "#JD49CT#2",
            "referenceImage": "setParent.png"
        },
        ...
}
```

`title` : a string used for Window title and logging results in the console
`playgroundId` : the snippet id of the playground you want to test
`referenceImage` : the reference image name you want to compare to. You don't have a reference yet, so choose a self-explanatory name with .png extension.

# Generate Reference Images

Your test list is updated and your playground is ready to test. it's now time to generate a reference image.
open `Apps\ValidationTests\Scripts\validation_native.js` and change `var generateReferences = false;` to true.
Run ValidationTest program, all reference images will be generated in `Apps/ValidationTests/Results` subfolder of your build directory.
Copy the reference image for your test from that folder to `Apps/ValidationTests/ReferenceImages` and add it with Git.

# Test new reference

Revert your change to `Apps\ValidationTests\Scripts\validation_native.js` and run validation tests.
Your new reference will compared to the rendering of your newly added Playground.
