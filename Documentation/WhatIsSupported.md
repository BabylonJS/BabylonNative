# What Is Supported?

Babylon.js has many, many features; and while the goal of Babylon Native
is to support an overwhelming majority of those features, not all parts of
Babylon.js are equally well supported by Babylon Native at this time. This
document is intended to help readers "eyeball it," checking quickly whether
a given type of feature is likely supported by Babylon Native at this time.
For more precise information about current and upcoming support for
particular features, please don't hesitate to ask us on
