### Using the Android Emulator

- Install HAXM by again opening the SDK Manager, checking *Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)*, then clicking *Apply*. If the installer fails, see [HAXM Installation Troubleshooting](#HAXM-Installation-Troubleshooting).
- Create an Android Emulator through the AVD Manager (Android phone icon in the upper right). Pixel 2 with API 27 has been tested.
- In Android Studio, click the *Run->Run App* menu item and select your device if prompted.

### HAXM Installation Troubleshooting

The HAXM installer can fail for a number of reasons. Many solutions are discussed in [HAXM issue 105](https://github.com/intel/haxm/issues/105), including:

- Enabling Intel virtualization in the bios
- Disabling Hyper-V in Windows
- Disabling memory integrity in Windows
- Disabling virtualization security with the Device Guard and Credential Guard hardware readiness tool

### OpenGL ES 3 and AR settings

Open GL ES3 is required on Android Emulator. Otherwise one will run into the following errors when deploying it onto the Android Emulator:

`
D/: .../bgfx/src/renderer_gl.cpp (5638): BGFX CHECK glTexParameteri(targetMsaa, 0x813D, numMips-1); GL error 0x500: GL_INVALID_ENUM
A/libc: Fatal signal 5 (SIGTRAP), code 128 (SI_KERNEL), fault addr 0x0 in tid 1398 (mqt_js), pid 1349 (com.playground)
`

The GLES3 setting needs to be enabled from the Android Emulator settings:

Ensure that the right Google Play Services for AR is installed on the Emulator per instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/emulator#update-arcore).
